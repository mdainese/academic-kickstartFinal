I'm currently a Senior Researcher at Eurac - Institute for Alpine Environment http://www.eurac.edu/en/research/mountains/alpenv

My research focuses on ecology and conservation of plants and insects in terrestrial ecosystems. I am particularly interested in understanding the ecological consequences of global change, including climate warming and land-use change, on plant and insect biodiversity.
