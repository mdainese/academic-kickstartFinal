# Abstract.
abstract = "Due to agricultural intensification, semi‐natural Arrhenatherion elatioris meadows are becoming rare in central Europe. Despite the increasing importance of their biodiversity value, little information is available on seed production which could be used to enlarge their regional presence. To contribute to this knowledge, the seed production of the major grass species were analysed for the spring growths of an Arrhenatherion elatioris meadow in 2003 and 2004. In the first study year, fertile culms of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Arrhenatherum elatius, Avenula pubescens, Dactylis glomerata, Holcus lanatus and Trisetum flavescens were collected on different dates and analysed for their reproductive efficiency. Floret site utilization was greater than 0·60 for all species and seed viability was above 80%, except for A. odoratum. Seed dormancy was present to a small extent only in A. odoratum and A. pubescens. With regard to the whole meadow, the density of fertile stems amounted to 850 m−2 (811 m−2 of which were grasses) and standing seed yield at seed maturity of the six grasses was about 33 100 seeds m−2. As a consequence of the increase in viability occurring during seed development, the maximum standing viable seed yield was reached later. The total number of seeds produced throughout the spring growth period was 2·8 times that of the maximum standing seed yield. The quality and quantity of the seed production from spring growth make it suitable for establishing species‐rich semi‐natural grassland provided that seed obtained from the second cut is included to increase the presence of legumes and forbs."
