abstract = "The tundra is warming more rapidly than any other biome on Earth, and the potential ramifications are far-reaching due to global-scale vegetation-climate feedbacks. A better understanding of how environmental factors shape plant structure and function is critical to predicting the consequences of environmental change for ecosystem functioning. Here, we explore the biome-wide relationships between temperature, moisture, and seven key plant functional traits both across space and over three decades of warming at 117 tundra locations. Spatial temperature-trait relationships were generally strong but soil moisture had a marked influence on the strength and direction of these relationships, highlighting the potentially important influence of changes in water availability on future plant trait change. Community height increased with warming across all sites over the past three decades, but other traits lagged far behind predicted rates of change. Our findings highlight the challenge of using space-for-time substitution to predict the functional consequences of future warming and suggest that functions tied closely to plant height will experience the most rapid change. Our results reveal the strength with which environmental factors shape biotic communities at the coldest extremes of the planet and will enable improved projections of tundra functional change with climate warming."
